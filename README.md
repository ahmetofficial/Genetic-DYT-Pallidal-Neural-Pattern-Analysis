# Analysis Scripts for "Spiking patterns in the globus pallidus highlight convergent neural dynamics across diverse genetic dystonia syndromes"

---

## **Overview**

This repository contains Python scripts and associated data processing tools used in our study on the neurophysiological characterization of genetic dystonia patients undergoing bilateral GPi-DBS surgery. These tools were developed to analyze and visualize neural dynamics, perform statistical tests, stratify genes, and build machine learning models.

The study's methodology and analysis cover a range of topics:
- Preprocessing of spiking neural data
- Statistical and machine learning analyses
- Gene stratification via thresholding and distance metrics

By sharing this repository, we aim to support reproducibility, foster collaboration, and advance research in the field of dystonia and DBS.
